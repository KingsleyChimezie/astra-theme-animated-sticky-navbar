# Astra Theme Animated Sticky Nav Bar (Coming Soon!) #
## By Kingsley Chimezie ##
### Intro 🎤 ###
Astra offers a wide range of WordPress themes.  
All the free Astra themes do not currently give you the option to have a sticky navigation bar.

Initially, I wrote the code for this project to help me tackle this problem on the WordPress websites I build and/or built using an Astra theme.  
After doing some quick Googling, I noticed that there are not many of solutions like mine. That's why I decided to release my code as a project.  
For now, I think it's the best solution out there 😁.

**I'm just adding the finishing touches to the project. The first release will be available soon.**

### The Project 📦 ###
- My code will allow you to easily integrate a clean and animated 'sticky-icky' feature with your existing Astra nav bar 👌🏿
- All you have to do is set your variables within my code and everything will be automatically integrated
- A clear instructional video will be available on my YouTube channel [Software Basics](https://youtube.com/SoftwareBasics)

### Terms and Conditions 📜 ###
- My code is free to use for your personal / commercial projects
- Selling my code or claiming it as your own is strictly prohibited ⚠
- Do not remove my credits and give credit where credit is due

### Donations 💶 ###
Astra might make some future changes that could cause my code to not work well (or at all) with your Astra theme.  
Donations will allow me to keep my code updated and functional for everyone.

### Premium Support 💻 ###
If you need help with any integration or issues, I can give you dedicated remote support for 20 Euro.  
First contact me via email only --> [📧](mailto:info@kingsley.tech?subject=Support%20For%20Astra%20Theme%20Animated%20Sticky%20Nav%20Bar)

### Future Plans 📓 ###
I'm hoping to build this out into a WordPress plugin.  
I wanted to start out this way but I'm just too busy for what it's currently worth.  
Make it worth while by donating 😉.
