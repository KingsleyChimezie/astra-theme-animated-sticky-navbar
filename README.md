### Supporter Pack Version 🙏 ###
I've decided to limit some features to a premium version - don't worry, you still get all the main features in the standard version.

Here's what you get with the supporter pack:  

✅ Shrink or enlarge branding area on scroll (i.e. logo, title and description) for Desktop & Mobile/Tablets  
✅ Enable or disable sticky feature for the primary, above or below navbars.  
✅ Set custom colour for above or below navbars.

**€2 for one-time purchase (code & license)**
-   You get the support pack version at the time of purchase.  

**€12 for lifetime updates (code & license)**
-   You get support pack version at the time of purchase and all future updates, it doesn't matter if prices change in future.
-   Better get it now while it's cheap 😊

Purchase links will be available soon, in the meantime you can contact me if you would like to buy the supporter pack code & license.

### Future Plans 📓 ###
I'm hoping to build this out into a WordPress plugin.  
I wanted to start out this way but I'm just too busy for what it's currently worth.  
Make it worth while by donating 😉.
