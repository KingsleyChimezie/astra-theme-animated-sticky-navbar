# Astra Theme Animated Sticky Nav Bar / Header

## By Kingsley Chimezie ##

### Intro 🎤 ###
Astra offers a wide range of WordPress themes.  
All the free Astra themes do not currently give you the option to have a sticky navigation bar.

Initially, I wrote the code for this project to help me tackle this problem on the WordPress websites I build and/or built using an Astra theme.  
After doing some quick Googling, I noticed that there are not many solutions like mine. That's why I decided to release my code as a project.  
For now, I think it's the best solution out there 😁.

### The Project 📦 ###
- My code will allow you to easily integrate a clean and animated 'sticky-icky' feature with your existing Astra nav bar 👌🏿
- All you have to do is set your variables within my code and everything will be automatically integrated
- A clear instructional video will be available on my YouTube channel [Software Basics](https://youtube.com/SoftwareBasics)

### Prerequisites ✅ ###
* [Simple Custom CSS and JS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-css-js/) - Install this plugin, it will allow you to embed my code on your WordPress site.

### Donations 💶 ###
Astra might make some future changes that could cause my code to not work well (or at all) with your Astra theme.  
Donations will allow me to keep my code updated and functional for everyone.

### Future Plans 📓 ###
I'm hoping to build this out into a WordPress plugin.  
I wanted to start out this way but I'm just too busy for what it's currently worth.  
Make it worth while by donating 😉.
